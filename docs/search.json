    "text": "8 Benefits of negative feedback)\n\n8.1 Gain Desensitivity\nTo investigate the effect that a variation on the open-loop gain \\(a\\) causes on the closed-loop gain \\(A\\) we differentiate \\(A\\) w.r.t. \\(a\\) \\[\nA = \\dfrac{a}{1+ab}\n\\] \\[\n\\dfrac{dA}{da} = \\dfrac{ 1 + ab - ab}{(1+ab)^2} = \\dfrac{1}{(1+ab)^2}\n\\] \\[\n\\Delta A = \\dfrac{\\Delta a}{(1+ab)^2}\n\\] \\[\n\\dfrac{\\Delta A}{A} = \\dfrac{\\Delta a}{A} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{(1 + ab)^2} =\n\\dfrac{\\Delta a}{\\dfrac{a}{1+ab}} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{(1 + ab)^2} = \\dfrac{\\Delta a / a}{(1+ab)}\n\\] Thanks to feedback, a fractional change in the gain of the basic amplifier is reduced by a factor \\(1+L = 1 + ab\\) in the closed-loop. Conceptually, the loop gain \\(L\\) can be be made arbitrarily large. The loop gain is a key parameter and as we will see later it plays an important role also in bandwidth and impedance calculations.\n\n\n8.2 Effect of feedback on non-linearity\nAmplifiers are made up of transistors. Since, transistors are non linear devices, the transfer charateristic of any practical amplifier is non-linear. Assume a basic amplifier that besides the desired linear relationship, also exhibits a cubic relationship between its input and output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Effect of negative feedback on non-linearity\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nv_{out} &= a_1 (v_{in} - b v_{out}) + a_3 (v_{in} - b v_{out})^3\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1}\\] \\[\n\\begin{split}\n&v_{out} = A_1 v_{in} + A_3 v_{in}^3 + \\space ...\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 2 into Equation 1 we get: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nv_{out} &= a_1 (v_{in} - b A_1 v_{in} - b A_3 v_{in}^3 - ... ) + a_3 (v_{in} - b A_1 v_{in} - b A_3 v_{in}^3 - ...)^3 \\\\ &=\na_1 v_{in} - a_1 b A_1 v_{in} - a_1 b A_3 v_{in}^3 + a_3 [ v_{in}(1-bA_1)]^3 + \\space ...\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nand equating back into Equation 2: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nA_1 \\cancel{v_{in}} &= a_1 \\cancel{v_{in}} - a_1 b A_1 \\cancel{v_{in}}\n\\leftrightarrow A_1 (1 + a_1 b) = a_1 \\\\\nA_1 &= \\dfrac{a_1}{1+a_1 b}\n\\end{split}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{split}\nA_3 \\cancel{v_{in}^3} &=  - a_1 b A_3 \\cancel{v_{in}^3} + a_3 \\cancel{v_{in}^3}  (1 - b A_1)^3 \\leftrightarrow\nA_3 (1+a_1 b) = a_3  (1 -b \\dfrac{a_1}{1+ a_1 b} )^3 = a_3 \\dfrac{1}{(1+ a_1 b)^3} \\\\\nA_3 &= \\dfrac{a_3}{(1+a_1 b)^4}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe linear term (as expected) is reduced by \\(1 + L\\).\nThe cubic term is reduced by \\((1+L)^4\\).\n\n\n8.3 Effect of feedback on bandwidth\nAs an example, assume the transfer function of the basic amplifier is the following: \\[\na(j\\omega) = \\dfrac{a_0}{1+\\dfrac{j\\omega}{\\omega_p}}\n\\] Then, the closed-loop transfer function is \\[\nA(j\\omega) = \\dfrac{a(j\\omega)}{1+ a(j\\omega) \\cdot b} = \\dfrac{a_0}{1+ a_0 b} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{1+\\dfrac{j\\omega}{\\omega_p} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{(1+ a_0 b)}}\n\\] The gain is reduced by \\(1 + L_0\\), but the bandwidth is increased by \\(1+L_0\\).\nThe product of gain and bandwidth remains constant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Gain magnitude vs. frequency for the basic amplifier and the feedback amplifier\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Effect of feedback on input/output resistances\nIn actual applications the input and output resistances (a.k.a. terminal resistances) of the amplifier play a key role. When an amplifier is driven by a non ideal source and drives an output load, the input resistance forms a divider with the source’s resistance, and the output resistance forms a divider with the load, therefore reducing the overall gain from source to load. This reduction is usually referred as loading effect. Negative feedback modifies the terminal resistances in ways that tend to reduce the impact of loading.\n\n8.4.1 Series-shunt (voltage-voltage) feedback configuration - Voltage Amplifier\nLet’s consider the application of negative feedback around a voltage amplifier. In this case feedback is performed sampling the output voltage and then feeding back a voltage that is a scaled version of the output voltage “into” the external input voltage source driving the amplifier. Note that the operation of voltage sensing at the output is performed in parallel, or shunt (when we measure a voltage we place the voltmeter in parallel, never in series), while to combine the external input voltage source and the voltage returned by the feedback network we connect them in series (to connect two voltage sources we place them in series, never in parallel).\nTo focus on the effect of negative feedback on \\(r_i\\) and \\(r_o\\) of the basic amplifier, we assume there is no loading effect on both ports of the basic amplifier. To neglect loading at the input’s of the basic amplifier, we assume that the sources \\(v_{in}\\) and \\(b v_{out}\\) have zero series resitances. To neglect loading at the output’s port of the basic amplifier, we assume the output port of the basic amplifier is left open and the input port of the feedback network has infinite resistance.\nNote: for the series-shunt feeback configuration, b is unitless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The ideal series-shunt configuration or voltage amplifier (Franco 2015)\n\n\n\n\\[\nR_{in} = \\dfrac{v_{x}}{i_{x}} = r_i (1+L)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{out} = \\dfrac{v_t}{i_t} = \\dfrac{r_o}{1+L}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: (a) test circuit for the calculation of the input impedance and (b) test circuit for the calculation of the output impedance\n\n\n\nFor \\(L \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the series-shunt configuration gives \\(R_{in} \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and \\(R_{out} \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\n\n8.4.2 Shunt-shunt (current-voltage) feedback configuration - Transimpedance Amplifier\nLet’s consider the application of negative feedback around a transimpedance amplifier. In this case feedback is performed sampling the output voltage and then feeding back a current that is a scaled version of the output voltage “into” the external input current source driving the amplifier. Note that to combine the external input current source and the current returned by the feedback network we connect them in parallel or shunt (to connect two current sources we place them in parallel, never in series).\nTo neglect loading at the input’s of the basic amplifier, we assume that the sources \\(i_{in}\\) and \\(b v_{out}\\) have infinite parallel resistances. To neglect loading at the output’s port of the basic amplifier, we assume the output port of the basic amplifier is left open and the input port of the feedback network has infinite resistance.\nNote: for the shunt-shunt feeback configuration, b has dimensions of \\(1/ \\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The ideal shunt-shunt configuration or transimpedance amplifier (Franco 2015)\n\n\n\n\\[\nR_{in} = \\dfrac{r_i}{1+L}\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{out} = \\dfrac{r_o}{1+L}\n\\]\nFor \\(L \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the shunt-shunt configuration gives \\(R_{in} \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(R_{out} \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\n\n8.4.3 Series-series (voltage-current) feedback configuration - Transconductance Amplifier\nLet’s consider the application of negative feedback around a transconductance amplifier. In this case feedback is performed sampling the output current and then feeding back a voltage that is a scaled version of the output current “into” the external input voltage source driving the amplifier. Note that the operation of current sensing at the output is performed in series, or shunt (when we measure a current we place the ampmeter in series, never in parallel).\nTo neglect loading at the input’s of the basic amplifier, we assume that the sources \\(v_{in}\\) and \\(b i_{out}\\) have zero series resistances. To neglect loading at the output’s port of the basic amplifier, we assume the output port of the basic amplifier is shorted and the input port of the feedback network has zero resistance.\nNote: for the series-series feedback configuration, b has dimensions of \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The ideal series-series configuration or transconductance amplifier (Franco 2015)\n\n\n\n\\[\nR_{in} = r_i (1+L)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{out} = r_o (1+L)\n\\]\nFor \\(L \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the series-series configuration gives \\(R_{in} \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and \\(R_{out} \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\n\n\n8.4.4 Shunt-series (current-current) feedback configuration - Current Amplifier\nLet’s consider the application of negative feedback around a current amplifier.

    "text": "10 Systematic Feedback Analysis Frameworks\n\nTwo-port Analysis\n\nProposed by Harold Black\nHelpful for gaining basic intuition about feedback\nMap the feedback network onto one of 4 topologies\n\nvoltage-voltage (serie-shunt), current-voltage (shunt-shunt), voltage-current (series-series), current-current (shunt-series), depending on the desired input/output quantities\n\nIn practice, the feedback network “\\(b\\)” (and possibly the forward amplifier “\\(a\\)”) are not unilateral, so mapping arbitrary circuits into a generic “\\(ab\\)” block diagram that uses two-ports is not obvious\nThe feedback network causes loading at the input and output of the basic amplifier\n\nmodel the feedback network as an ideal two-port and absorbe the loading effects into the basic amplifier. This procedure is often quite tedious.\n\n\nSome feedback circuits cannot be modeled using two-ports\n\ne.g. bias circuits with feedback loops tend to have only one port\n\n\nReturn Ratio Analysis\n\nProposed by Hendrik Bode\n“Asymptotic” method”, does no attempt to break the circuit into pieces\nThe closed-loop properties of the feedback circuit are described in terms of the return ratio of a dependent source in an active device.\nThe block diagram used to analyze the closed loop properties of the feedback circuit is extended to handle the feedforward through the feedback network\nOften easier than two-port analysis\n\n\n\n10.1 Return Ratio Analysis\n\n10.1.1 Closed-loop gain using return ratio\nGiven a feedback amplifier, with a controlled source of value k (see Figure 33), the closed loop gain can be derived as shown in (Gray et al. 2009): \\[\nA = \\dfrac{s_{out}}{s_{in}} = A_\\infty \\cdot \\dfrac{T}{1+T} + \\dfrac{d}{1+T}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 33: Feedback amplifier: return ratio framework to derive the closed-loop gain\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, the expression for the closed loop gain can be summarized through the block diagram in Figure 34: \\[\n\\left(s_{in} - \\dfrac{s_{out}}{A_\\infty}\\right) \\cdot T A_\\infty + d \\cdot s_{in} = s_{out}\n\\] \\[\nA = \\dfrac{s_{out}}{s_{in}} = A_\\infty \\cdot \\dfrac{T}{1+T} + \\dfrac{d}{1+T}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 34: Block diagram for closed-loop gain using return ratio framework\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three terms needed to find the closed loop gain (\\(A_\\infty\\), \\(T\\), \\(d\\)) are all directly computable and measurable (SPICE), and do not rely on any idealization of the feedback network.\nIn practical circuits the feedback network loads both the input and output of the amplifier, so idealizing its effect is not realistic. With two-port analysis incorporating the effect of loading without the use of suitable approximations/idealizations of the feedback network becomes extremely tediuos.\nThe return ratio analysis does not try to identify the transfer function of the basic amplifier and the feedback network separately. It aims to identify directly the gain around the feedback loop. From the loop gain of a circuit, we can determine:\n\nstability\nclosed loop gain\nnodal impedances\n\nThe return ratio analysis can be applied to any arbitrary feedback circuit, independent of topology and port structure.\nThe return ratio for a dependent source in a feedback loop is found as follows:\n\nSet all independent sources to zero\nidentify a dependent source in the feedback loop that you want to analyze and break the loop by disconnecting the dependent source from the rest of the circuit. Leave the dependent source open-circuited if it is of the voltage type, or short-circuited if it is of the current-type\nOn the side of the break that is not connected to the dependent source, inject an independent test source \\(s_t\\) of the same sign and type as the dependent source\nFind the return signal \\(s_r\\), generated at the controlled source that was disconnected\nThe return ratio \\(T\\) for the dependent source is \\(T=-s_r/s_t\\)\n\nProvided that we have chosen a controlled source that breaks the loop globally, the return ratio of the dependent source is equal to the loop gain of the circuit.\nFor the stabilty analysis of a feedback circuit we must have the loop gain not just any return ratio. Unless, we have a single loop feedback circuit, the return ratios computed for different dependent sources are not necessarily equal (Hurst 1991), so in general, the return ratio is not a global property of the loop. (Hajimiri 2023)\n\n\nThe direct feedthrough \\(d\\) is given by:\n\\[\nd = \\dfrac{s_{out}}{s_{in}} |_{k = 0}\n\\]\nwhich is the transfer function from input to output evaluated for k = 0. In other words, the direct feedthrough \\(d\\) is\nthe signal transfer from input to output through the passive elements, it represent a signal path from input to output that goes around rather than through the controlled source k.\nThe value of \\(A_\\infty\\) is the closed loop gain when the feedback circuit is ideal (that is when \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\)). If \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\) then \\(A = A_\\infty\\), because \\(\\dfrac{T}{1+T} \\rightarrow 1\\) and \\(\\dfrac{d}{1+T} \\rightarrow 0\\)\nSince letting \\(k \\rightarrow \\infty\\) causes \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\) (Gray et al. 2009) the value of \\(A_\\infty\\) can be easily found by evaluating \\[\n\\dfrac{s_{out}}{s_{in}} |_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\n\\]\nWhen \\(k \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the controlling signal \\(s_{ic}\\) for the dependent source must be zero for the output of the controlled source to be finite. The controlled source output will be finite if the feedback is negative.\nThe key difference between the return ratio analysis and the two-port analysis can be seen comparing Figure 34 and Figure 35 In the two-port analysis all forward signal transmission is lumped in the block \\(a\\). In the return ratio analysis, there are two forward signal paths: one path (\\(d\\)) for the feedback network and another path (\\(TA_\\infty\\)) for the forward gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 35: Block diagram model for closed-loop gain using the two-port framework\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5 - common source stage with current source biasing\nConsider the circuit in Figure 36 and its AC equivalent model in Figure 37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 36: Common source with current-source biasing\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent source biasing in this circuit doesn’t work without feedback setting the drain voltage. The resistive feedback \\(R_2\\) constrains the drain and gate voltages to be equal.\nGiven the finite gain and the nature of the impedances of the MOS, in this circuit is hard to decouple a(s) and b(s), so using the two-ports analysis is not a good option. \\[\nA(s) =  \\dfrac{a(s)}{1+a(s)b(s)}\n\\]\nIn this case, since the circuit is not very complex we can use exact nodal analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 37: AC equivalent model of the feedback circuit in Figure 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{v_{in}-v_x}{R_1} + \\dfrac{v_{out}-v_x}{R_2} = 0\\Leftrightarrow \\dfrac{v_{in}}{R_1} - \\left( \\dfrac{1}{R_1} + \\dfrac{1}{R_2} \\right) \\cdot v_x + \\dfrac{v_{out}}{R_2}=0\n\\tag{3}\\] \\[\n\\dfrac{v_x-v_{out}}{R_2} = g_m v_x \\Leftrightarrow v_x=\\dfrac{v_{out}}{1-g_m R_2}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nSubstituting Equation 3 in Equation 4: \\[\n\\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = \\dfrac{1 - g_m R_2}{1+g_m R_1} = - \\dfrac{R_2}{R_1} \\left( \\dfrac{1-\\dfrac{1}{g_m R_2}}{1+\\dfrac{1}{g_m R_1}} \\right)\n\\]\nIf the \\(g_m R\\) terms are much greater than 1, the result is the same as the op amp solution.\nLet’s now confirm that return ratio analysis produces the same result.\nReturn ratio calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 38: return ratio calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(v_{gs} = - R_1 i_t\\)\n\\(i_r = g_m v_{gs} = - g_m R_1 i_t\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} = - g_m R_1\\)\n\\(T \\equiv - \\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} = g_m R_1\\)\nIdeal closed loop gain calculation\n\\(A_\\infty\\) is the transfer function when the gain element of the controlled source becomes \\(\\infty\\).

The bias circuit in Figure 41 is know as constant-\\(g_m\\) reference or \\(\\Delta V_{GS}\\) reference.\nNote: this circuit has only one-port so it cannot be analyzed using the two-ports framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41: Constant-\\(g_m\\) reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nI_{REF} \\cdot R_2 &= V_{GS1} - V_{GS2} = V_{OV1} - V_{OV2} \\\\\n&\\approx V_{OV1} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\right)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\\[\nI_{REF} \\approx \\dfrac{V_{OV1} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\right)}{R_2}\n\\]\n\nThis circuit has positive feedback.\nA positive feedback system is stable only if its loop gain is less than 1 (\\(T &lt; 1\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42: AC equivalent model of the constant-\\(g_m\\) bias circuit\n\n\n\n\n\nTo identify which dependent source to use for computing the loop gain \\(T\\) of the circuit, the feedback loop we break must be global.\n\n\\(M_2\\) and \\(R_2\\) degeneration, form a local feedback loop, so \\(M_2\\) cannot be used to break the main loop\n\\(M_1\\) and \\(M_4\\) are diode-connected; their transcondactance elements are equivalent to a resistance \\(1/g_m\\), so cannot be used to break the main loop\n\\(M_3\\) is the only “normal” CS gain stage in the circuit, so it is the only element that can be used to break the main loop\n\nIn general, the return ratio of CG, CD, or degenerated CS cannot be used to find the “global” loop gain of a circuit.\nTo compute the loop gain \\(T\\) of the circuit, it is convenient to first unroll and linearize the AC equivalent model in Figure 42:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 43: Unrolled AC equivalent model for the constant-\\(g_m\\) bias circuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 44: Small signal equivalent model for the constant-\\(g_m\\) bias circuit, (a) red: circuit features that make \\(s_t\\) insertion not possible, (b) blue: best place for \\(s_t\\) insertion\n\n\n\n\n\nand then insert the test source:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 45: Computing the return ratio for the constant-\\(g_m\\) bias circuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(i_r = g_{m3}v_4\\)\n\\(i_t = - g_{m1}v_1\\)\n\\(v_4 = -i_2 \\left( 1/ g_{m4}\\right)\\)\n\\(i_2 = g_{m2} v_2\\)\n\\(v_1 = v_2 + g_{m2}v_2 R_2 \\Leftrightarrow v_2 = \\dfrac{v_1}{\\left( 1+g_{m2}R_2 \\right)}\\)\nPutting the pieces together:\n\\(\\dfrac{i_r}{i_t}= \\left(-\\dfrac{g_{m3}}{g_{m1}}\\right) \\left(- \\dfrac{g_{m2}}{g_{m4}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1+g_{m2}R_2}\\right)\\)\nTherefore: \\(T = -\\dfrac{i_r}{i_t}= -\\left(\\dfrac{g_{m3}}{g_{m1}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{g_{m2}}{g_{m4}}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1+g_{m2}R_2}\\right)\\)\nThe resulting return ratio is negative (i.e. the feedback is definitely not negative, even at zero frequency). The challange is to keep the magnitude of the return ratio less than unity (\\(|T| &lt; 1\\)).\nThe loop has two inverting gain blocks, each loaded with a “diode connected” MOS device. The gain block formed by \\(M_3\\) is loaded by the diode connected MOS \\(M_1\\) and the gain block formed by \\(M_2\\) and \\(R_2\\) is loaded by the diode connected MOS \\(M_4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 46: Small signal equivalent model for the constant-\\(g_m\\) bias circuit\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7 - potential stability issue of the constant-\\(g_m\\) reference\nConsider the design of the constant-\\(g_m\\) reference circuit in Figure 47:\nAssume: \\(I(M_3)=I(M_4)=I_{REFN}=100 μA\\)\n\\(V_{OV1} = 200 mV\\)\n\\(m=2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 47: Constant-\\(g_m\\) reference: design example\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the given circuit:\n\\(g_{m4}=g_{m3} = g_{m1} = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 100 μA}{200 mV} = 1 mS\\)\nRecalling that:\n\\(V_{OV2} = \\dfrac{V_{OV1}}{\\sqrt{m}}\\)\n\\(I_{REF} = \\dfrac{V_{OV1} \\left( 1- \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\right)}{R_2}\\)\nfor m=2:\n\\(V_{OV2} = 141 \\space mV\\)\n\\(R_2 = 586 \\space \\Omega\\)\n\\(g_{m2}=\\dfrac{2 \\cdot 100 μA}{141 mV} = 1.41 \\space mS\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{g_{m2}}{1+g_{m2}R_2} = 772 \\space μS\\)\nThe magnitude of the return ratio is less than 1:\n\\(|T| = \\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} = \\left( \\dfrac{g_{m2}}{1+g_{m2}R_2} \\right) \\left(\\dfrac{1}{g_{m4}} \\right) \\left( \\dfrac{\\cancel{g_{m3}}}{\\cancel{g_{m1}}} \\right)= 0.772 \\space (&lt; 1)\\)\nTherefore, the circuit designed is stable, but is possible to have problems.

In general, the return ratio of a controlled source is a measure of how much of the signal generated by that controlled source is returned due to feedback, it is not necessarily the loop gain. (Hurst 1992)\nFor negative feedback circuits T &gt; 0\nIn an ideal feedback system \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and the closed loop gain is \\(A_{\\infty}\\)\nBlackman’s formula gives the closed-loop impedance in terms of two return-ratios. The formula is the same for any type of feedback circuit, and it applies to any port (not only the input and output ports)\nReturn-ratio analysis is often simpler than two-port analayis\nReturn-ratio analysis uses equations that are independent of the type of feedback.\nTwo-port analysis uses four-feedback configurations (series-series, series-shunt, shunt-series, and shunt-shunt), therefore, the type of feedback must be correctly identified before starting the analysis\nIn practice, all physical networks are multiloop feedback structures. Unwanted local return loops exists around individual transistor through the parasitic capacitances (Tian et al. 2001) (Behmanesh and Andreani 2023). Dealing with multiple feedback mechanisms makes identifying an appropriate controlled source to use for the return ratio analysis more difficult. When dealing with multiloop feedback structures, the controlled source used to compute the return ratio, must be one that breaks the loop globally (Hurst and Lewis 1995).\nOne aspect that is often cause of confusion, about return-ratio analysis and two-port analysisis is that the loop gain L computed through two-port analysis and the loop gain T computed using the return ratio, can be different. This is because they are intrinsically two different measures of transmission, however both methods lead to correct closed-loop expressions and both can be used to check stability (Chiu 2012).\n\nExample 15 - Voltage gain and output resistance of common source with degeneration using return ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 72: Common source with degeneration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvoltage gain (assuming \\(r_o\\) negligible)\n\n\\[\nA_v = \\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = A_{\\infty} \\cdot \\dfrac{T}{1+T} + \\dfrac{d}{1+T}\n\\]\n\\(A_{\\infty}\\) is the gain of the circuit when the gain element k of the controlled source tends to \\(\\infty\\) (note that if \\(k = g_m = \\infty\\), for the current of the dependent source to be finite, it must be \\(v_{gs} = 0\\)).\n\\(A_{\\infty} = \\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} |_{g_m \\rightarrow \\infty}= - \\dfrac{R_D}{R_S}\\)\n\\(d\\) is the gain of the circuit when the gain element k of the controlled source equals 0.\n\\(d = \\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} |_{g_{m} = 0} = 0\\)\n\\(T\\) is the return ratio of the dependent source.\nTo compute the return ratio instead of separating the dependent source from the rest of the circuit and replacing it with an independent source of the same kind as always done so far, we will follow an equivalent procedure consisting in adding an independent source \\(s_x\\). In practice, this procedure is usually more easily performed, because it does not require tearing the original circuit apart. See (Middlebrook 2006) and (Hajimiri 2023).\nThe introduction of \\(s_x\\) is completely equivalent to using an independent source \\(s_t\\) in place of the separated dependent source and monitoring the signal \\(s_r\\) that returns to the separated dependent source.\n\\(s_t = s_x + s_r\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 73: Small signal model to find the return ratio of \\(g_{m}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(v_{gs} = - i_t R_S\\)\n\\(i_r = g_m v_{gs} = - g_m R_S i_t\\)\n\\(T = -\\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} = g_m R_S\\)\nTherefore, as expected:\n\\[\nA_v = \\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}} = A_{\\infty} \\cdot \\dfrac{T}{1+T} + \\dfrac{d}{1+T} = \\dfrac{-g_m R_D}{1 + g_m R_S}\n\\]\n\nOutput resistance\n\n To find the output resistance we use Blackman’s formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 74: Small signal model to find the output resistance$\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output resistance with \\(g_m=0\\) is:\n\\(R_{out}(g_m=0) = R_S = r_o\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 75: return ratio with output port open\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the output port open:\n\\(v_{gs} = - i_t R_S = 0 \\Rightarrow i_r = g_m v_{gs} = 0\\)\nSo, the return ratio with the output port open is:\n\\(T_{open} = - \\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} |_{open} = 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 76: return ratio with output port shorted\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the output port shorted:\n\\(v_{gs} = - (R_S || r_o) \\cdot i_t \\Rightarrow i_r = g_m v_{gs} = - g_m \\cdot (R_S|| r_o) \\cdot i_t\\)\nSo, the return ratio with the output port shorted is:\n\\(T_{sc} = - \\dfrac{i_r}{i_t} |_{sc} = g_m (R_S||r_o)\\)\nAnd the output resistance is:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nR_{out} &= R_{out}(g_m=0) \\cdot \\dfrac{1 + T_{sc}}{1 + T_{open}} = (R_S + r_o) \\left( 1 + g_m\\dfrac{R_S r_o}{R_S + r_o} \\right) = \\\\\n&= R_S + r_o (1 + g_m R_S)\n\\end{split}\n\\]"
